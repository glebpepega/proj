# proj
Proj is a full-fledged microservice for storing data, modifying data with third-party APIs, caching data and many more.

To connect to other services Kafka queues were implemented. For storing data I used Postgres as a primary database and Redis for caching. Also I desided to dockerize the app so that it can run anywhere.
